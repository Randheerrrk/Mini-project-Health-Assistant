# PrimeAide - The Health Assistant App

PrimeAide is a Mini-project done by [Arshu](https://github.com/arshupt), [Denil](https://github.com/tupio)(Me), [Randheer](https://github.com/randheerrrk) & Subash. It is made to enable basic diagnosing of the common diseases when doctors are unreachable. Though initial development focussed on making it completely offline solution, we resolved to online because of a lack of on-device processing power required and the complexity associated with it.
